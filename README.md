# Synopsis

This is an *experimental* provider which allows Terraform to create
and update DNS zones, records, monitoring jobs, data sources and
feeds, and other resources with the [NSONE](http://nsone.net/) API.

# Example use

    provider "nsone" {
      api_key = "xxxxxxx" # Or set NSONE_APIKEY environment variable
    }

    resource "nsone_datasource" "api" {

      source_id = "${nsone_datasource.api.id}"
      config {
        label = "exampledc1"
      }
    }

    resource "nsone_datafeed" "exampledc2" {
      name = "exampledc2"
      source_id = "${nsone_datasource.api.id}"

# Support / contributions

I'm planning to continue developing and supporting this code for my use-cases,
and I'll do my best to respond to issues and pull requests (and I'm happy to take
patches to improve the code or add missing feaures!).

Also, please be warned that I am *not* a competent Go programmer, so please expect
to find hideous / insane / non-idiomatic code if you look at the source. I'd be
extremely happy to accept patches or suggestions from anyone more experience than me:)

Please *feel free* to contact me via github issues or Twitter or irc in #terraform (t0m)
if you have *any* issues with, or would like advice on using this code.
